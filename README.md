This repo contains the tasks assigned to me during virtual internship at CodSoft. It has helped me a lot in solidifying my core concepts.

## Number Guessing game:
* The Number Guessing Game is a console-based application written in C++.
* In this game, the program randomly selects a number within a user-defined range, and the player has to guess the number. 
* The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. When the user correctly guesses the number, a celebratory message is displayed.

## Calculator:
* It is a simple C++ console-based calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation to perform.

## Tic Tac Toe Game:
* This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. 
* It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. 
* The game alternates turns between the players, checks for a winner or a draw after each move, and provides an option to play another game after the current game ends.

## ToDo List:
* This is a simple console-based To-Do List Manager implemented in C++. 
* It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks. 
* The program is designed to provide a straightforward and user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks.

## Library Management System (LMS):
* It is a simple console-based Library Management System implemented in C++. 
* It manages books, borrowers, and transactions, including book checkout, return, and fine calculation for overdue books. 
* The program provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to interact with the system.
